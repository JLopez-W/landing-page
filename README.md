# Landing Page
## Flexbox assignment for The Odin Project
<br>
This landing page was done as a flexbox exercise for the foundations section of The Odin Project.
<br>
<br>
The assignment was to create a landing page to match the given design as closely as possible using
flexbox. The design provided for the assignment is in the images folder.
<br>
<br>
After completing the main objective of the assignment, I wanted to play with the colors and content more
to give it a more personalized look while continuing to improve my understanding of flexboxes as well as other basic
HTML/CSS.
